# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict the duration of NYC taxi trips using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various trip details such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, and other relevant features.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of NYC taxi trip records with features including:
- `pickup_datetime`: Timestamp of when the trip started.
- `passenger_count`: Number of passengers in the taxi.
- `pickup_longitude` & `pickup_latitude`: Pickup coordinates.
- `dropoff_longitude` & `dropoff_latitude`: Drop-off coordinates.
- `trip_duration`: Target variable (trip duration in seconds).

## ðŸ”§ Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Key preprocessing and feature engineering steps include:
- Handling missing values.
- Converting timestamps to useful time-based features (e.g., hour, weekday, etc.).
- Calculating the haversine distance between pickup and drop-off points.
- Removing outliers to improve model performance.

## ðŸš€ Model & Evaluation
A **Ridge Regression** model was used to predict trip duration. The evaluation metric for this project is the **RÂ² score**, which achieved **71% accuracy**.

## ðŸ“Š Results & Insights
- The model performs well with an RÂ² score of 0.71, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual trip durations.
- Feature engineering, such as adding distance-based features, significantly improved model performance.
- Further improvements can be achieved by experimenting with advanced models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
